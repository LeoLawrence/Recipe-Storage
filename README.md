## FAQ

#### Why did you make this project?

I wanted to branch out of procedural programming and focus on learning JavaScript frameworks. Instead of making CLI tools like most of my other projects, I made this full-stack web application to help teach myself things like React, Node, Express, MongoDB, JWT, and user authentication.

#### Is this project deployed?

At the moment, this project is not deployed and is still a work-in-progress. I am looking to deploy the project soon after making the front-end look better.

#### When will this project be complete?

There is not ETA on when this project will be complete. I still have a lot more to learn about the technologies, but I feel like this was an excellent starting place for me.
